# PixZip - Image search for developers made easy!

> PixZip makes it easy for developers/designers to download a bunch of license-free images from popular websites likes Pexels, PixaBay and Unsplash.

No longer do you need to open multiple tabs and download every picture separately!

PixZip allows you to search for images on popular search engines and download them all at once inside a ZIP archive.

## Features (Easy as 1, 2, 3)

1.  ### Search royalty-free images on popular search engines
2.  ### Drag and drop your favorite images into the zip library
3.  ### Download a compressed zip archive containing the pictures you chose
